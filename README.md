### Dry Bean Class prediction using Machine Learning Techniques.
#### Motivation to solve the Problem
Dry Beans are one of the most consumed edible legumes in the world. Seed quality effects the crop production. It is hence essential to classify seeds for optimal production and revence as well as for sustainable farming.

### Dataset and Publications Used
- The data is obtained from the following   [`dataset`](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Dry+Bean+Dataset).
- The motivation for the problem is sourced form the following [ `paper`](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0168169919311573?via=ihub). This paper helped me to understand the underlying the scientific basis for this problem.

### Goals of the Project
- Performing EDA on the given Dataset to analyse the data better
